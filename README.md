# Hagrid.css

## Intro
Hagrid is a basic lightweight grid, not a CSS framework. It's based on [Simple Grid by Dallas Bass](http://thisisdallas.github.com/Simple-Grid/) with new features:

* pixel-perfection for modern browsers with calc()
* full support for many column sizes
* bug fixes
* an example page host on GitHub 
* a license to allow everyone to use and fork the grid 

Hagrid is built for responsive layouts. With fluid columns, the grid will resize to adjust to the browser resolution. To accomodate for mobile and tablet devices, the grid will essentially stack all columns, one above another, when viewed on smaller screens (max width = 768px). The CSS contains classes to choose if a class has to be visible/hide on specific width devices.

##How to use it
All the informations about how to use the grid are available on [the example page](http://).

##Why Hagrid ?
Hagrid is a kind character from Harry Potter and his name contains "grid", so I choose this name. 

Hagrid.css is not a fork of [Simple Grid](http://thisisdallas.github.com/Simple-Grid/) because it hasn't been updated since months and the author didn't answer when I asked him what license is for his project. Hagrid is not Simple Grid: all the code is on GitHub and the license is setted.
